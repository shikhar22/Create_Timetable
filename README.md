### Hello All
I'm Shikhar and I've made a timetable generator on react js.
I've added an add course option, delete course and a clear timetable option
which works in an obvious way. 


You can filter through every column to select your desired course, instructor, section etc.


I've made it to not accept multiple courses on the same time slot and multiple sections for the same course.
 
The external packages/ modules that I used are ej2 syncfusion scheduler, ag-grid and light-toast.

PS- I couldn't work on the UI much because of the whole going to campus thing
