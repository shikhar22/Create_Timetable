### Hello All
I'm Shikhar and I've made a timetable generator on react js.
I've added an add course option, delete course and a clear timetable option
which works in an obvious way. 
The external packages/ modules that I used are ej2 syncfusion scheduler, ag-grid and light-toast.

PS- I couldn't work on the UI much because of the whole going to campus thing
